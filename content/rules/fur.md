# Rules for /fur/

Make sure to read the above, the only Global Rules that don't apply to the /fur/ bot are #4 and exception to #8 where you can advertise a channel with furry art in, NOT a telegram group but a CHANNEL, don't advertise channels that advertise groups either.



Below are a list of rules for @furryloungebot on Telegram, they can be updated at any time with notice given in the bot by a mod/adminsay.


{{% ruleify %}}
Do not discuss topics unrelated to furries or the furry fandom. Some off-topic is allowed, but keep it short.

Topics such as politics, guns, and outside drama are NOT allowed and will result in the messages getting removed.

We have a bot for POLITICS over at [/pol/](https://t.me/politicsloungebot), use that instead.

Use a group chat or DMs for drama.
-
Do not post media or discuss topics which are considered "extreme".

We can't post a full list but to get an idea:
- cub
- watersports
- scat
- fisting
- inflation
- vore
- gore
- diapers
- hyper donut assholes

If a mod sees something you post as extreme and it is removed and you feel as if it wasn't, leave a message in the Support Bot and we will try to get back to you as soon as possible.
-
On-topic self-promotion is allowed, as long as it is not done excessively.
-
Adding to [Global Rule #8]({{< ref "#g8" >}}), advertising is also saying the name of a channel/group/bot without the @ before it, as well as splitting up the name. E.g. "It's in furry lounge bot"
-
Do not complain about content you don't like, delete it your side and move on. Everyone has different tastes.
-
Adding to [#5]({{< ref "#r5" >}}), any complaining about media (unless against the rules) will be removed.
-
Do not reply to stuff with "MODS" excessively or anything of that sort, we don't get notified and it looks like spam when we do eventually get around to deleting stuff. Once is usually enough.
-
If you do find something to be against the rules, leave a message in the Support Bot above and we will try to deal with it as soon as possible.
-
Signing your message for no good reason (e.g "/s hello", "/s how is everyone") is not allowed and the message will be removed, only sign for something useful e.g. if someone wants to PM you. Fake signing will always be removed.
-
Adding to [Global Rule #10]({{< ref "#g10" >}}), calling someone out as a pedo/rapist/zoo or saying they like cub/bestiality is frowned upon and will be removed.
-
We do not tolerate hate speech or targeting of users whether they are in the bot or not.
-
Do not complain that X breaks rules if it doesn't, an don't be a smartass when a mod or admin tells you to move on.
